# Data Analysis - Analytic problem solving with SQL and Pandas

Looking for a more bite-sized approach to improve your analytical and data engineering skills over time? This problem set is for you!

The following problems will give you analytics based scenarios that you need to solve with either SQL or Pandas.

Completing this problem set WILL make you a better data engineer and data analyst.

The problems will give you the tools to more efficiently work with large datasets and come up with code to automate your analysis.

All problems listed below come from https://www.stratascratch.com/.

StrataScratch is an excellent resource to find technical questions and exercises utilized in Data Engineering and Data Analyst interviews at top companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and more.

Don't try to complete the entire list of problems all in one sitting. Take the time to dig into each question. 

## We recommend you focus on 1-2 problems a day. 

Take the time to study the solutions to the problem, and understand how each part of the solution code works.

## How to engage with these problems

When taking on these problems, you should try to solve them on your own for 15-20 minutes, **but no longer than that**.
Not knowing the answer is fine. You want to ensure you give yourself time to work your brain to solve it, but not waste time if you just don't have the knowledge.

After 15-20 minutes, you can then view other peoples solutions in the "Solutions" tab in the LeetCode window.
When you view the solution, you should then take the time (at least 25 minutes at a time) to understand how the solution works, adding it to your own code window and changing pieces of it to help understand what each part does. 
Then, take a 5 minute break. After that break, come back and try to solve the problem on your own again with no help.

## Data Analysis - Dataset Analysis

You may use any SQL variant available or Python-Pandas to solve these problems.
Use the dropdown in the top left corner of the window to change the language used for the question and any displayed solutions.
